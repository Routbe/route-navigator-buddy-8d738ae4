## Architecture rules
- Neon (`DATABASE_URL`) is the only database; schema changes are idempotent files in `db/NN_*.sql`. Why: the app is deployed on Vercel outside Lovable Cloud.
- Login ON rout.be (Better Auth, `better-auth.server.ts`) and login VIA rout.be (OIDC provider, `src/lib/oauth/*`) never share config; provider env vars use the `ROUT_PROVIDER_*` prefix. Why: prevents one role breaking the other.
- Sign-in tiles are always rendered; unconfigured providers show a notice instead of sending a request. Why: missing keys must never hide options.
- Public profile visibility (`publicProfile`, `timelineVisible` in `display_prefs`) is enforced server-side in the public profile/timeline server functions. Why: client checks alone leak data.
- Influencer/business verification hands out names through the `approved_handles` whitelist (`db/45`); users claim exactly one via `claimApprovedHandle`. Why: the admin approves names, never types them for the user.
- Bluesky/Mastodon accounts without a provider-verified email are created or linked only after a hashed 6-digit email code (`fediverse-otp.server.ts`, `db/46`). Why: typed emails alone allow account takeover.
- Birthdates live in the separate `user_birthdates` table (`db/48`) and are written only via `saveMyBirthdate`; verification requests return `birthdate_required` until present. Why: keeps legal data out of profile mass-assignment paths.
